part 2 : Dive into the code

## Dive into the code
Always keep in mind to ***fix performance issues*** on the most blocking issues, don't do this for the sake of doing it. [Gold plating], time that could have been on more higher priority part of code.



*** Library + no threads = errors ***

- User not able to use it fast
- User loose interest in launching it




***[ScreenShot dine Nimbledroid's onCreate]***
in the onCreate, we can see 3 methods taking most of the time
UserPreferences
JodaTime
other one

Checking in the code
***Screenshot of onCreate***
Separation and cleanup of onCreate



- Singleton pattern is not the solution, welcome single instance
